Welcome to **Algorithm Arena**, an algorithm testbed where users can solve coding problems with a gamified perspective. Our platform allows users to submit solutions to various algorithmic challenges, and it evaluates their performance. Built with a multi-container architecture, Algorithm Arena is designed for scalability and engaging competition.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Algorithm Battles:** Choose from a curated list of problems with varying difficulty (easy, medium, hard), and test your algorithms in real-time.
- **Leaderboard:** Track your progress and compete with the top five users displayed on the leaderboard.
- **Log-in System:** Sign up or log in to track your progress. Your achievements are stored in our AWS-hosted database, and log-ins are remembered using cookies.
